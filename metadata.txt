about=The Attribute Transfer to Schema plugin for QGIS simplifies the process of transferring attribute data between vector layers with differing schemas. Designed for users working with a template layer (e.g., with fields like ID, Name, Address, UID, Area, Length, Date) and a source layer with potentially different field names, types, or counts (e.g., ID, Nme, Addr, UUID, Shape_Area, Shape_Length, Remark, Others, Date), this plugin ensures precise data transfer. Key features include: Interactive Field Mapping: A intuitive GUI with two dropdown lists allows users to manually map fields from the source layer to the template layer, ensuring only desired attributes are transferred. Schema Preservation: Unmatched fields in the template layer remain blank, maintaining the integrity of the predefined schema. Flexible Workflow: Supports copying features and selectively transferring attribute values based on user-defined mappings.
